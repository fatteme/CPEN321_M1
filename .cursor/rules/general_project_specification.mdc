The project implementation must comply with the following rules.

# Technology stack

You are required to develop a client-server software system with the client (app) running on a mobile device and the backend running on the cloud.
## Client Side
- Must be a mobile application that run natively on Android (not in a browser)
- Must run on at least one real device and on a Pixel 9 emulator running Android S (API 31).
- Must be written in Kotlin
- Must use Jetpack Compose 
- Using other frameworks, e.g., Expo, ReactNative, Xamarin, Flutter, etc. is not permitted.
## Server Side
- Must run on Node.js
- Must be implemented in TypeScript
- If your backend uses a database, you must use MongoDB. 

## Forbidden Frameworks
Using third-party services, such as Firebase, AWS Amplify, Azure Functions and App Service, Azure Supabase, Parse Platform, and MongoDB Atlas/Realm, to implement major project functionality, e.g., database management, authentication, and critical application operations, is strictly forbidden. 

An exception to this rule is Firebase's push notification support, which is permitted. 

If you plan to use any third-party library or service not listed here to support a major functionality of your project, please check with me beforehand, to make sure the use of the specific library is allowed and the functionality will be considered as part of your work.
# Code Management 
All code of the project (app and backend) should be stored in **one** Git repository, well-structured internally.
