# Hobby Feature Implementation

## Overview
The hobby feature allows users to select and manage their hobbies from a predefined list. Users can view, select/deselect, and save their hobby preferences through the profile screen.

## Backend Implementation

### Models
- **User Model**: Extended to include a `hobbies` field as an array of strings
- **Validation**: Hobbies are validated against the available hobbies list

### API Endpoints
- `GET /hobbies` - Retrieves all available hobbies
- `POST /user/hobbies` - Updates user's selected hobbies
- `GET /user/profile` - Returns user profile including hobbies

### Data Structure
```typescript
// Available hobbies (from constants/hobbies.ts)
export const HOBBIES = [
  'Reading', 'Writing', 'Photography', 'Cooking', 'Gardening',
  'Painting', 'Drawing', 'Pottery', 'Running', 'Yoga',
  'Chess', 'Video Games', 'Travel', 'Language Learning',
  'Coding', 'Blogging', 'Surfing', 'Skiing'
];

// User model includes hobbies
interface IUser {
  // ... other fields
  hobbies: string[];
}
```

## Frontend Implementation

### Data Models
- **User.kt**: Extended to include `hobbies: List<String>`
- **ApiResponse.kt**: Added `HobbiesResponse` and `UpdateHobbiesRequest`

### API Service
- **ApiService.kt**: Added endpoints for hobbies management
- **AuthRepository.kt**: Implemented hobby-related API calls

### ViewModel
- **ProfileViewModel.kt**: Manages hobby state and operations
  - `loadProfile()`: Loads user profile and available hobbies
  - `toggleHobby()`: Toggles individual hobby selection
  - `saveHobbies()`: Saves selected hobbies to backend

### UI Components
- **ProfileScreen.kt**: Displays hobbies using Material3 FilterChips
  - Hobbies section positioned after user details
  - Horizontal scrollable list of hobby chips
  - Save button at bottom of profile page
  - Loading states and error handling

### Features
- **Chip-based Selection**: Uses Material3 FilterChips for modern UI
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected hobbies show checkmark icons
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate UI updates on selection changes
- **Persistence**: Hobbies are saved to backend and restored on profile load
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user feedback

## User Experience Flow

1. User navigates to Profile screen
2. Profile loads with current user data and available hobbies
3. User sees their currently selected hobbies as selected chips
4. User can tap chips to select/deselect hobbies
5. User clicks "Save Hobbies" button to persist changes
6. Success/error feedback is shown via snackbar
7. On return to profile, selections are preserved

## Technical Details

### State Management
- Uses Kotlin StateFlow for reactive UI updates
- Separate states for available hobbies and user selections
- Loading and error states for better UX

### API Integration
- Retrofit for HTTP communication
